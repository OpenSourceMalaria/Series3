# Series 3
Everything related to [Open Source Malaria](http://opensourcemalaria.org/) (OSM) Series 3. 

The starting point is a molecule called OSM-S-106 that was identified by a screen performed by GSK Tres Cantos in 2010. Since then, Open Source Malaria, in collaboration with the Medicines for Malaria Venture, have been progressing this compound and its analogs. The series possesses attractive properties (potency, good half-life) and a novel mechanism of action as an antimalarial.

For things under investigation, look at active Issues (link above) or the list in the [original To Do List](https://github.com/OpenSourceMalaria/OSM_To_Do_List/issues?q=is%3Aopen).

The [wiki](https://github.com/OpenSourceMalaria/Series3/wiki) describes where the project is up to. The [original wiki page](https://openwetware.org/wiki/OpenSourceMalaria:GSK_Amino-thienopyrimidine_Series) is no longer being updated.  

For a description of the first OSM series, and of the general approach taken by OSM, read [the first paper](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acscentsci.6b00086).
